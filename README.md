# Image-Proccessing
This repository contains a collection of basic and advanced image processing programs. It includes operations like grayscale conversion, filtering, edge detection, thresholding, noise removal, and image transformations. The goal is to help students and beginners understand digital image processing using Python and OpenCV.

## Features
- Load and display images
- Convert to grayscale
- Adjust brightness and contrast
- Thresholding (simple and adaptive)
- Image filtering:
  - Mean filter
  - Gaussian filter
  - Median filter
- Edge detection:
  - Sobel
  - Prewitt
  - Canny
- Noise removal
- Histogram and histogram equalization
- Image transformations (rotate, flip, crop)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Suitable For
- Students learning Image Processing
- Academic projects
- Computer vision beginners
- OpenCV learners
